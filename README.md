#  Heart Disease Prediction

This project is focused on predicting the presence of heart disease in patients based on various clinical features. It involves a complete data analysis workflow, including EDA, feature engineering, and model building using multiple classification algorithms.

## 📌 Project Goals
- Perform thorough exploratory data analysis (EDA) on clinical data
- Visualize relationships between key features (age, cholesterol, heart rate, etc.)
- Handle outliers and prepare clean data for modeling
- Compare multiple classification models for predicting heart disease

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries Used
- Python  
- Pandas & NumPy  
- Matplotlib (Pyplot)

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis
- *Univariate, **Bivariate, and **Multivariate* analysis performed  
- Plots used: Scatter plots, histograms, bar charts, correlation matrix
- Target: Predict whether a patient has heart disease (binary classification)

## Data Preprocessing
- Handled missing values
- Outlier detection and removal
- Feature scaling and encoding where required

## 🤖 Machine Learning Models Used
- *Logistic Regression*  
- *Decision Tree Classifier*  
- *Random Forest Classifier*  
- *Support Vector Machine (SVM)*  
- *Naive Bayes*  
- *Gradient Boosting Classifier*  
- *XGBoost Classifier*

## 📌 Results
- Identified key risk factors (e.g., age, chest pain type, cholesterol levels)
- Most accurate models: *XGBoost* and *Random Forest*
- Compared all models using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
